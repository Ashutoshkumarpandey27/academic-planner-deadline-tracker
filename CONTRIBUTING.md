   ```

## 📋 How to Contribute

### Finding an Issue

1. Browse the [Issues](https://github.com/yourusername/academic-planner/issues) page
2. Look for labels that match your skill level:
   - `good first issue` - Great for newcomers
   - `beginner` - Basic HTML/CSS tasks
   - `intermediate` - JavaScript functionality
   - `advanced` - Complex features
   - `help wanted` - High priority items

3. Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it

### Making Changes

1. **Write clean, readable code** following our coding standards
2. **Test your changes** thoroughly in multiple browsers
3. **Comment your code** where necessary
4. **Follow the existing code style** and structure

### Coding Standards

#### HTML
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Proper indentation (2 spaces)
- Include appropriate ARIA labels for accessibility
- Keep it clean and organized

#### CSS
- Use meaningful class names (BEM methodology preferred)
- Organize properties logically
- Comment complex styling
- Ensure responsive design
- Test across different screen sizes

#### JavaScript
- Use ES6+ features
- Write clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Handle errors gracefully
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use const/let instead of var

### Commit Guidelines

Write clear, meaningful commit messages:

```
Add feature: brief description

- Detailed point about what changed
- Another detail if needed
- Reference issue number (#123)
```

**Good examples:**
- `Add course filtering functionality (#12)`
- `Fix: Resolve deadline sorting bug (#45)`
- `Improve: Enhance mobile responsiveness for dashboard`

**Avoid:**
- `Update`
- `Fix bug`
- `Changes`

   - Description of what you changed and why
   - Reference to the issue number (e.g., "Closes #123")
